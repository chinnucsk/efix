On most machines with Erlang and standard build tools in the path you
should be able to do:

> make
> bin/run

and have a system up and running.

There is not really any way to install the system.  Just run it as it
is.

Dependencies are:

GNU make 3.81 or later
autoconf
Erlang (don't know if there are version dependencies, I'm using R14B)
