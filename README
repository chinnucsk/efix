This is a FIX parser written in Erlang.

See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_Information_eXchange for

specification from http://fixprotocol.org/

To is a library and not really a runnable system.  If you want to run
it anyway you can do:

> make
> bin/run

Differences from specification:

FIX 4.4:

  According to the specification 139/MiscFeeType is of type CHAR but
  has enum valees that don't fit in a char.  This implementation has
  changed the type to STRING.  (This is also consistent with later
  versions of FIX.)

  MassCancelRejectReason is of type CHAR according to spec but has an
  enumeration value that is out of range (99).  Thus this
  implementation uses STRING.  (This is also consistent with later
  versions of FIX.)


For #spawnfest:

  There is a diary of my progress in DIARY.txt

  make test will fail a lot.  This is by design.  Most of the tests
  are created to test proper error behaviour.  If a test exits via
  throw with a reasonable exit value I consider the test successful.
  Unfortunately a lot of the tests in QuickFix are missing the
  mandatory field BodyLength.  I can only assume that this field is
  normally added by the QuickFIX test engine normally.  I'll have to
  rerun all the tests when I have an enviroment with the FIX parser
  listening to a port.

  TODO.txt contains a list of all the features of FIX which are not
  supported yet.
