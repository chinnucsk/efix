Differences from specification:

FIX 4.4:

  According to the specification 139/MiscFeeType is of type CHAR but
  has enum valees that don't fit in a char.  This implementation has
  changed the type to STRING.

  MassCancelRejectReason is of type CHAR according to spec but has an
  enumeration out of range (99).  Thus this implementation user
  STRING.
