In no particular order or priority:

* The parser returns a list of Key, Value pairs, this should be
  changed to make use of records.

* footer parsing

* Checksum handling

* Handling of encrypted messages

* All FIX versions should at least be able to handle the basic types.

* Handle all types

* Check that mandatory items are there

* I suspect that my code will hande repeating sequences badly.
  Test/fix.
