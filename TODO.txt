In no particular order or priority:

* The parser returns a list of Key, Value pairs, this should be
  changed to make use of records.

* footer parsing

* Checksum handling

* Handling of encrypted messages

* All FIX versions should at least be able to handle the basic types.

* Handle all types

* Check that mandatory items are there

* I suspect that my code will hande repeating sequences badly.
  Test/fix.


THING THAT ARE OUT OF SCOPE:

Most of these are out of scope since they need some sort of
(semi-)permanent storage.  The parser is an over-approximation of the
full FIX protocol.

* Checking of sequence numbers

* Checking user credentials
