This file is a diary of my progress.

Times are given in GMT, I'm currently in La Paz, Bolivia, which is
GMT-4. So the competition started at a nice eight o'clock in the
evening.

Sitting in the bar of the hostel where I live.

I realise that I have a lot of functions that could use an accumulator
and be tail recursive.  They run in constant time so I can't be
bothered.  I.e. it's only the code generator that has that type of
code, and the XML files are a known constant size.

Creating directory structury.

Copy of basic build structur from another project.

Adding lots of .gitignore files.

Copying xml files from quickfix code. Running 'for a in FIX*; do mv $a
$(echo $a | tr A-Z a-z); done' to make the files lowercas.

I know that I should probably add a COPYRIGHT file related to these
files, but that will have to be handled later. (QuickFIX has a very
lax license; don't worry.)

00:24

Cheese burger ordered.

Adding a fix_generate.erl stub file.

Adding Rules.mk for priv directory.  Which will eventually create one
fix parser file for each xml file.  I realise while I have done
autogenerated things in Makefiles before they have only been a single
file thus filenames have been hard coded.

Once again learning to use .SECONDEXPANSION the limitations it has.  I
never again want to write a dependency like $(d)/$$(basename
$$(@F)).xml or generate a file named $(@D)/../src/$(basename
$(@F)).erl

Still not sure whether the generating Rules.mk file should be in the
priv directory or the src directory.

Build broken.

01:04

Really realising that I've never used xmerl before.  Code looks ugly
as hell.

01:15

Stupid make dependencies.

Apparently the Rules.mk file should go in the src directory.

01:43

Commiting a code generator that generate files that compile. YAY!

Milestone 1 reached.

Second half of Peru vs. Mexico in Copa America is about to start.

Starting to write a test script.

03:00

Have a decent test script up and running.

People at the bar are very happy.  So am I, if for a completely
different reason. (Local time is 23:00)

Writing more fix_generate stuff.  Not really doing any progress.  This
has to change.

04:43

Headers can now be parsed in theory.  But only if they are
typeless. :-)

05:20

Dancefloor next to computer managed to grab my attention.

06:10

Back to laptop, with a quick solution to earlier problem.  How great
it is to take a break sometimes.

First full message has been parsed.  Yay!  Happy time!  I would
celebrate with a beer, except I just drank a Vodka-Coke.

07:08

Heading for bed.  (Local time is 03:08)

14:51

Computer up and running.  Eating breakfast.

Downloading specifications from the FIX webpage.  The definition of
data types change over versions.

16:43

The more I read my code the more I think that xmerl must have
functionality for what I do with list comprehension.  I wonder if that
would look as ugly, worse, or better.

Working on handling body parsing.  And enum handling.

The more I write the more I understand why I did not want to write
this in XSLT.  It's bad enough in Erlang.  :-)

17:32

Yay!  Code builds again.

Next step is to do some cleanup befor continuing.
